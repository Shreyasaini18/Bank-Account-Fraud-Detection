The Fraud Detection Framework for Bank Account Applications project aims to develop a machine learning-based framework to detect fraudulent activities in bank account applications. The framework employs various data pre-processing techniques, feature selection methods, and classification algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent applications. The project utilizes a publicly available dataset of bank account applications and uses various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of the framework. The proposed framework can assist financial institutions in detecting fraudulent activities and preventing financial losses.
The proposed framework has the potential to assist financial institutions in detecting fraudulent activities and preventing financial losses. It can also provide valuable insights into the patterns and characteristics of fraudulent applications, which can inform the development of more effective fraud detection systems. Overall, the project has significant implications for improving the security and reliability of bank account applications and financial transactions.
We have developed an adaptive model based on the dataset published at NeurIPS2022 which is a Base dataset containing 1M instances based on a real-world dataset. We have 11029 fraud counts against 988971 non-fraudulent counts. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, it possessed a great challenge for data preprocessing, data modeling, feature extraction, analysis, and analytics. We have used machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and  ANN to build fraud detection models. When constructing a fraudulent bank account detection model, it is very important to extract the right features from transactional data.
We have used different undersampling methods in order to get the correct model for our problem statement.
